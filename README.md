Compliance with software development standards refers to the adherence to established guidelines and best practices in the development, testing, and deployment of software. Here are some key points about compliance with software development standards:

Consistency: Compliance with software development standards ensures that software is developed consistently, which helps to ensure its quality, reliability, and maintainability.
Adherence to industry standards: Compliance with software development standards involves following established industry standards and guidelines, such as those set by ISO, IEEE, or SEI.
Compliance with regulatory requirements: Compliance with software development standards may be required by regulatory bodies in certain industries, such as healthcare or finance, to ensure the safety and security of software systems.
Documentation: Compliance with software development standards often requires thorough documentation of software development processes and procedures, as well as testing and validation procedures.
Testing and validation: Compliance with software development standards requires thorough testing and validation of software to ensure that it meets the required quality and reliability standards.
Traceability: Compliance with software development standards often involves maintaining traceability between requirements, design, implementation, and testing to ensure that software meets the desired functionality and quality.
Continuous improvement: Compliance with software development standards involves continuously monitoring and improving software development processes and procedures to ensure that they remain up to date and effective.
Collaborative effort: Compliance with software development standards requires the involvement and cooperation of all members of the development team, including developers, testers, project managers, and quality assurance specialists.

Operable

Let’s break each one of these down including some of the primary items needed to achieve compliance.

Perceivable
Information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive.

Text alternatives
Alt text
Captioning and descriptions
Audio controls
Ability to resize text
Don’t use images of text
Operable
User interface components and navigation must be operable.

The ability to navigate using your keyboard with no keyboard traps.
No “flashing” content to help avoid seizures
Page titles (good for screen readers)
Headings and labels
Understandable
Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.

Consistent navigation
Error identification (handling)
Labels or Instructions
Robust
Content must be enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

The Bottom Line
Here’s the good news. By using our content management system, Spinternet, many of these items can be managed all on your own. If not, they can be addressed when you design and build out your site. Again, remember that just because your site is in compliance today, doesn’t mean that it will be as you make new updates.

Ultimately, anything you can do to make your site more usable for assistive technologies is a good thing. Even if you are not able to do everything to gain a rating, it is still worthwhile to ensure your image Alt tags and captioning is done and you are also maintaining an easily navigable site. Many of the items listed are simply best practices for good sites and also have some great SEO value as well.

Check out this great reference guide that details each level and requirement.

There are also many evaluation tools available that you can run your site through. Just Google “wcag site checker” or “ada compliance checker.”
